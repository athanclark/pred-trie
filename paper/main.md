Predicative Tries
=================

- Unified tags vs. Isolated tags
    - Unified
        - Destructive nature for rewriting children between existentially seamed merges
    - Isolated
        - Predicative tags and Literal tags don't affect each other

- Existential Seam
    - For predicates, the (useful) elements of the predicate must be predefined
      (unless arity is generated through const), and is either constructive with
      merges (for identical node structures - isolation), or destructive with
      unified labeling schemas.
